Today was my last working day at Internshala and guess what! They sent me this picture as a farewell gesture! Looks amazing, isn't it ? :D

[Internshala](https://internshala.com) is a technology company on a mission to equip students with relevant skills & practical exposure through internships and online trainings. Back in June 2018, when I was in my summer vacation after first year at college, all I knew was C and C++. Hence, when I found this posting of C/C++ Teaching Assistant at [Internshala Trainings](https://trainings.internshala.com) on their website, I wanted to give it a shot. Being offered an internship initially for 3 months, I'm now bidding my farewell to Internshala after 2 years! 

My main responsibility was to answer the student queries on the C/C++ Trainings forum, which taught me a lot of things especially patience. I also had difficult queries which I myself had never seen. The good thing about Internshala is that eventhough I was a remote intern, my suggestions/feedbacks were taken into consideration.

If it was not Internshala, I would not have been able to buy my first ever iPhone with the stipend I was given. It was a really good experience.
