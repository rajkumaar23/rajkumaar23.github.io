I am Rajkumar, a curious engineer, ever in awe of the wonders 
that 0<sub>s</sub> & 1<sub>s</sub> could create, currently doing my Master of Science in Computer Science at Arizona State University. 

I started my development with mainly Android apps made out of Java, 
then got to explore web technologies such as [Laravel](https://laravel.com), NodeJS, Angular etc.

The software I mostly use are :
- Jetbrains suite of IDEs for development.
- Sublime Text for quick text editing.
- Sublime Merge for complex git stuff.
- [Duckduckgo](https://duck.com) mostly, [Startpage](https://startpage.com) rarely.

## Linux &hearts; Open Source
Ever since I felt bad/disgusted about using non-activated Windows in my first year of college,
I switched to Linux &hearts; (Ubuntu initially) and never looked back. 
During my four years of college, I have hopped between multiple Linux distributions 
and out of everything, my favourite has been [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io) 
because it's simple, clean and less intrusive thus letting me be more productive.


## Apple 👨🏻‍💻
I am also a huge fan of Apple products, and their obsession in UI detailing 
&amp; providing a seamless user experience across their products. 
I currently possess an iPhone XR, and a MacBook Air (i5 10<sup>th</sup> gen) for my daily personal usage.
 
## Security x Privacy 👻 
I have always had a fantasy for exploiting software as much as I loved developing them, 
and I look forward to learning more about it, especially on web security. Until now, I have reported more than 
a couple of bugs, and have received bounties worth $400 in total.
***
I also care/preach a lot about [privacy](https://privacytools.io) and 
how it's exploited these days.

## Analytics 📈
This site uses privacy-friendly web analytics software called [Plausible](https://plausible.io), which doesn't track any of your personal data and is hosted on a Raspberry Pi at my home.
