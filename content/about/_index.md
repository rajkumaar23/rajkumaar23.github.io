Here's a brief intro â€“ since Rajkumar is not quite as famous as Robert Downey Jr. to say, "You know who I am."
{{< /lead >}}

**Rajkumar** is a curious software engineer who's always in awe of the wonders that 0<sub>s</sub> and 1<sub>s</sub> could create. He boasts a robust background in software development spanning over two and a half years at [CodeChef](https://codechef.com) and [Cruise](https://getcruise.com) combined. His current role is at [Hewlett Packard Enterprise](https://hpe.com) within the SaaS team under the [ML Development Environment](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/hpe-machine-learning-development-environment.html) division.

His educational journey commenced with a <a target='_blank' href='/pdf-js/web/viewer.html?file=/academics/btech.pdf'>B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering</a> from Amrita University in 2021, followed by the attainment of <a target='_blank' href='/pdf-js/web/viewer.html?file=/academics/ms.pdf#page=2'>MS in Computer Science</a> with distinction from Arizona State University in 2023. Rajkumar is passionate about building impactful products for the society and advocating for free & open-source software.

Rajkumar relishes being referred to as a "poly-code-glot", as he quickly adapts to multiple programming languages/technologies. He loves to automate mundane tasks and conduct testing & deployment activities on his Raspberry Pi. During his leisure time, he indulges in non-fiction [reading](/books/shelf), culinary pursuits, or catches up on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com).
