      <description>elementary OS has been my favourite Linux distro for quite a long time because of its beautiful UI, less bloatware which lets me focus on the work that needs to be done. After having used the OS, I wanted to contribute to it in some way or the other.

Being a hard-core techie, I wanted to bring an end to this and hence Amrita Repository was developed.
It started off as a Python CLI application providing access to only question papers which later extended itself to an android app and a telegram bot with much more helpful features.</description>

      <description>I’m a regular user at LinkedIn and I came across the Software Development Engineer Internship’s poster by CodeChef when I was browsing through the feed one day.
