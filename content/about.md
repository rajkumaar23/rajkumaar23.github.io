I am a curious software engineer pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Arizona State University, currently interning in the Developer Environments team at [Cruise LLC](https://getcruise.com). I am constantly in awe of the wonders that 0<sub>s</sub> and 1<sub>s</sub> can create, and I have a great appreciation for the world where imagination dances with algorithms, and the possibilities, my friend, are as infinite as the digits of Ï€.

As a developer, I've delved into various technologies, including Java for Android app development, Laravel, NodeJS, Angular, and more. When it comes to software, I'm a big fan of the Jetbrains suite of IDEs for development, Sublime Text for quick text editing, and Sublime Merge for all my complex git needs. As for search engines, I mostly use Duckduckgo, although I do occasionally dabble with Google for programming related queries.

I have a particular passion for Linux &hearts; and open-source software. In fact, I've been a proud Linux user since my first year of college, and I've hopped between multiple distributions over the years. My favorite is currently [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io) for its simple, clean, and non-intrusive interface, which allows me to be more productive.

Aside from Linux, I'm also a huge fan of Apple products and their obsession with providing a seamless user experience. I currently use an iPhone XR and a MacBook Air (i5 10<sup>th</sup> gen) for my daily personal usage.

One of my biggest fascinations is software exploitation, and I find myself just as intrigued with breaking software as I am with building it. I've reported numerous bugs and have even received bounties. I'm particularly interested in web security and look forward to learning more about it.

In addition to software security, I'm also a strong advocate for privacy. As they say, "If you're not paying for a product, then you're the product." That's why I care deeply about privacy and often preach about it on my website. I encourage everyone to check out [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io) to learn more.

As for analytics, my website uses privacy-friendly web analytics software called [Plausible](https://plausible.io), which doesn't track any of your personal data and is hosted on a Raspberry Pi at my home.
