Picture this scenario -\u0026gt; you\u0026rsquo;ve just arrived in a foreign country, full of anticipation and ready to embark on new adventures. You eagerly open WhatsApp to connect with your friends and family back home, only to find a long list of unnamed contacts staring back at you. Quite frustrating, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? But fear not! I have the perfect solution to spare you the hassle of manually updating each contact with the correct country code. Allow me to introduce vCard Editor, a simple web app that effortlessly resolves this problem!\nWelcome to yet another chapter in my journey of developing tools that I wished existed. During my first international trip for my post-graduate education in the United States, I encountered a perplexing issue. Upon arrival, I noticed that most of my WhatsApp chats displayed unnamed contacts. It dawned on me that this occurred due to switching to a US carrier, which silently added an invisible (+1) prefix to contacts in my list lacking a country code. This phenomenon persists irrespective of the destination country, wherein the default country code is systematically added as an invisible prefix to all contacts in your list that do not possess a designated country code.\nThe magnitude of contacts without a country code in my list was overwhelming. Manually updating each one would have been an absolute nightmare. Despite my search for a reliable and private solution, I found none. Thus, I resorted to exporting my contacts as a VCF file and tediously performing a traditional find-and-replace using a text editor. However, this approach was highly unreliable.\nDriven by the need for a better solution, I built vCard Editor, now accessible at https://vcard-editor.rajkumaar.co.in.\nTraveling abroad should be about embracing new experiences, not fretting over contact management. With vCard Editor, you can swiftly add country codes to your contacts in bulk, reclaiming your valuable time and eliminating unnecessary frustration. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to give it a try now and kindly share your feedback!\nWhile the webapp utilizes the popular ical.js library for parsing VCF files, I strongly advise maintaining a backup of your original .vcf file at all times.\nPrivacy at the Forefront #Your contact list remains exclusively within your web browser throughout the entire process. It is never transmitted or shared with any third party. Rest assured that your information is private and secure.\nDetailed Steps #To effortlessly add country codes to your contacts using vCard Editor, follow these straightforward steps:\nExport your contacts as a .vcf file. Detailed instructions on how to export your contacts can be found on the web app.\nVisit https://vcard-editor.rajkumaar.co.in and upload the .vcf file you exported in the previous step.\nAdjust the configurations as necessary and verify the changes using the Preview tab.\nPlease note that vCard Editor will only update contacts that do not already have a country code. Existing contacts with a country code will remain unchanged. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Export updated .vcf\u0026rdquo; button on the web app.\nImport the newly generated file back onto your mobile device.\nMost modern devices should automatically update the existing contacts without creating duplicates. However, if you encounter any duplicates, delete all contacts and import the updated file again. Voila! All your contacts without a country code will now be equipped with the country code you chose!\nSource Code #Find the source code on GitHub.\nExperience Smooth Sailing #Should you encounter any issues with the app, please report them here. Your feedback is invaluable and will contribute to the continuous improvement of vCard Editor.\n","date":"2 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/vcard-editor/","section":"Posts","summary":"Are you preparing for an exciting journey abroad?","title":"vCard Editor"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/vcf/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"vcf"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/android/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"android"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/application/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"application"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/notifications/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"notifications"},{"content":"When I came to the US for my master’s, it was an unavoidable need to have access to the OTPs or calls that come to my Indian number, which, by the way, I left at home. Since it was not feasible to make a human relay the OTPs every time the Indian number received one, I built an app to forward them automatically to my Telegram chat and called it ‘Notify Abroad’.\nDownload #You can find the latest version of APK on GitHub.\nInstructions # Create a Telegram account if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one already, before proceeding to the next step. Create a Telegram bot with the help of Botfather. Note down the token associated with the bot. Do not share this token with anyone. Open your bot\u0026rsquo;s chat and press the START button. This is important! Otherwise, the bot can\u0026rsquo;t send you any notification. With the help of Chat ID Echo Bot, note down your own Telegram user ID. Open the Notify Abroad app, enter both the token \u0026amp; your user ID and save the settings. Hola! All your messages/calls will be forwarded to your Telegram chat. Important - Some devices prevent the app from running in background to optimize its battery. To override that, you can add Notify Abroad to the battery optimization exemptions. This can usually be done by changing the app\u0026rsquo;s battery optimization setting to \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t optimize\u0026rdquo; under Settings \u0026gt; Apps \u0026gt; All apps \u0026gt; Notify Abroad \u0026gt; Battery.

According to a survey by The Healthy Work Company, a workplace mental health consultancy, 22% of respondents had taken up a new pastime in lockdown, while 35% had rediscovered an old one. In this article, I wanted to share my experiences on how I spent the past year locked inside four walls.\nWhen everyone was obsessed with the Dalgona coffee, I spent my free time exploring finance and investing. Often I have been clueless when elders used to talk about sharemarkets when I was young, and I used to get overwhelmed whenever I tried to perceive how the market functioned. It was long due, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad I finally got the opportunity to get an overall idea of how stocks work, their nomenclature for various actions, and of course, the risks associated with it. I did learn quite a bit and experimented by investing in a handful of stocks. The Varsity app by Zerodha, the largest brokerage firm in India, has an extensive curated collection of stock-market lectures and was indeed helpful in providing me with a kickstart into the monetary universe.\nI have always been a technology addict, spending most of my time with the screen. But sometimes, it takes a toll on your mental health when you are endlessly scrolling the infinite feed \u0026amp; swiping the distracting stories on the artificially intelligent social media. I experienced this when using Instagram for hours \u0026amp; hours, ending up with no constructive information but a burnout of my strength. By then, the Signal revolution had started, and I realised it was the right time for me to reduce my Instagram usage.\nSubsequently, I started reading books and the inspiration comes from Rahul, who is building Bimape that aims to make insurance effortless. My first book during the lockdown was Digital Minimalism, where Cal Newport talks about how engineers have designed the technological systems to be addictive, and not the other way around. He also emphasises the importance of spending time alone and reclaiming leisure. However, I continue to use Twitter because I do not want to be blind to the media. Instead, I wish to leverage the power of technology by following only the list of accounts that I wish to get inspiration and insights from.\nI always have loved Apple\u0026rsquo;s design aesthetic and was curious to understand the thoughts of the human behind. Hence, the next book I started reading was the biography of ex-Chief Design Officer of Apple Inc., Sir Jonathan Ive. He has played a vital role in the designs of the iMac, Power Mac G4 Cube, iPod, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and parts of the user interface of iOS, among other products. I\u0026rsquo;m currently reading the famous book titled \u0026ldquo;Thinking Fast \u0026amp; Slow\u0026rdquo; by Daniel Kahneman. I am also maintaining my digital bookshelf here to keep track of all the books I have read, currently reading and want to read.\nLately, I have been catering to my long procrastinated interest in hacking systems. I have always had a fantasy for exploiting software as much as I love developing them, and I look forward to learning more about it, especially on web security. By learning \u0026amp; experimenting with the thinking process of an attacker, I am now more informed of the ways with which I can defend from vulnerabilies when building applications. Until now, I have reported more than a couple of bugs ranging from XSS to leaking of personally identifiable information and have received bounties worth about $400 in total from various organisations. All of the reports I submitted were to private vulnerability disclosure programs, which restricts me from writing about the exploits. However, I hope that I will soon find a vulnerability on a public bug bounty program and write a detailed article on it.\nThese hobbies have instilled a lot of confidence in me to try out new things, and I wish to explore further while reading more books and hacking more software.\n","date":"27 June 2021","permalink":"/posts/boredom-books-bugs/","section":"Posts","summary":"With millions of people stuck at home during the COVID-19 crisis, many explored various new hobbies to keep themselves occupied and ensure that they are not unduly stressed.","title":"Boredom, Books \u0026 Bugs"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/bugs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"bugs"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/lockdown/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"lockdown"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/security/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"security"},{"content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s see how to build a basic Java Enterprise (fondly known as J2EE) application, made up of a Servlet and a JSP file, with the help of the popular IDE by Jetbrains, IntelliJ Idea. Finally, we will have a look at how to deploy the same on the Heroku cloud. 🌧\nIn the first place, I\u0026rsquo;m writing this blog because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a full-fledged write-up on how to do this myself initially and I had to try and err to find out the right way to do it.\nRequirements # Java Development Kit, which can be downloaded from here. IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition, download it here. The ultimate edition is paid, but comes with a 30-day trial license. However, as long as you are a student, you can claim an educational license for free. More about it here. Heroku account. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have, create one for free here. Heroku CLI. Find the instructions here. Tomcat server. You need to download the same from this link, under Binary Distributions \u0026gt; Core \u0026gt; zip. After downloading, make sure to extract the contents to any folder of your wish. If you\u0026rsquo;re on Linux/macOS, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to enable executable permission for the tomcat binaries by running the following command on your terminal. sudo chmod -R +x \u0026lt;path-to-tomcat-extracted-folder\u0026gt;/bin Let\u0026rsquo;s start engineering! # Open IntelliJ Idea Ultimate and create a new project. Create a Java Enterprise project, with Maven as the build tool, JUnit as the test runner, and Java as the language. In the next window, under Specifications, mark the checkbox for Servlet and ignore the rest. Regarding the project name and properties, you can fill in as you wish, and click on Finish! Now, the creation of the project is complete and the IDE might take sometime to load all the necessary plugins/dependencies. If you look at the project directory, there will be a pom.xml at the root of the file. This is the file which Maven uses to maintain the dependencies of your project. Essentially, it\u0026rsquo;s similar to a package.json in NodeJS (or) composer.json in PHP. Incase you ever want to add a library, say MySQL connector, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to get its dependency XML tag from here and paste inside your pom.xml. After which, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a tiny dialog on your top-right with a refresh button which on clicking will install the newly added package.\nJSP # Let\u0026rsquo;s create a JSP file. Right click on Project Folder \u0026gt; src \u0026gt; main \u0026gt; webapp from the sidebar, and create a JSP file named hello.jsp, and fill in some JSP content. Click on Add configuration at the center top. After the window opens, click on the + button as instructed, and choose Tomcat server \u0026gt; Local. Give it a name as you wish, and near the Application server input box, click on the configure button. Now, enter the folder path where you extracted the zip of the Tomcat server. If you see a warning at the bottom saying No artifacts marked for deployment, click the Fix button near the warning and choose ProjectName:war exploded. Then, click Okay. Now, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a neat Run button at the top. Click on it and wait until Java compiles your web app and opens your default browser. Your browser would have opened the URL of your application context, similar to localhost:8080/J2EEDemo_war_exploded. This is the root of your web application. Append /hello.jsp to your current URL (it becomes http://localhost:8080/J2EEDemo_war_exploded/hello.jsp) and enter. You\u0026rsquo;ll see the contents you wrote in your hello.jsp. Servlet # Let\u0026rsquo;s create a Servlet now. Right-click on Project Folder \u0026gt; src \u0026gt; main \u0026gt; java from the sidebar and create a new Java Servlet. Enter the name and package as you wish. Under the doGet() method, paste the following code : @WebServlet(name = \u0026#34;LoginServlet\u0026#34;) public class LoginServlet extends HttpServlet { protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException { PrintWriter out = response.getWriter(); out.println(\u0026#34;You are at login page\u0026#34;); } } Next thing to do is assign an URL to this servlet. Open src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml and paste the following : Make sure you change the servlet-class according to your package and class name.\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;web-app xmlns=\u0026#34;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee\u0026#34; xmlns:xsi=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\u0026#34; xsi:schemaLocation=\u0026#34;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd\u0026#34; version=\u0026#34;4.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;servlet\u0026gt; \u0026lt;servlet-name\u0026gt;LoginServlet\u0026lt;/servlet-name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;servlet-class\u0026gt;in.co.rajkumaar.LoginServlet\u0026lt;/servlet-class\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/servlet\u0026gt; \u0026lt;servlet-mapping\u0026gt; \u0026lt;servlet-name\u0026gt;LoginServlet\u0026lt;/servlet-name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;url-pattern\u0026gt;/login\u0026lt;/url-pattern\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/servlet-mapping\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/web-app\u0026gt; Now, click on the Run button again and select Restart server. Visit http://localhost:8080/J2EEDemo_war_exploded/login to get the contents from the servlet. Heroku # Visit https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app and create a new app. On your IntelliJ Idea Ultimate, open the Build menu and click on Build artifacts. Choose AppName:war \u0026gt; Build.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see a J2EEDemo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war file inside the target/ directory of your application.

CodeChef’s interview process is very different unlike most other companies including its parent Directi. Due to COVID-19, my whole interview process was virtual.\nOnline Coding Round at CodeChef – 3 hours # 1st and 2nd question were of beginner level (Reference) 3rd question (Easy) – You are given an array A1,A2,...,An of size N. A pair (i,j) is good if and only if 1≤i\u0026lt;j≤N and Ai+Aj is a prime number. You need to find the number of good pairs in this array. (Trick: Using Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding primes) 4th question (Medium) - Modified knapsack question (Dynamic Programming) 5th question (Hard) – Based on DSU Out of these, I was able to solve 4 of them and I got into the next round.\nWeb App Development Round – 10 days of time # I was given the tech stack which I had to use – PHP (Slim Framework) + MySQL + ReactJS. I was given access to the official CodeChef API and the task was to build a contest arena with features like searching of contests, problems in it etc. Interesting thing here was that CodeChef APIs are rate limited. So I had to cache the data at an intermediate server for a specified interval of time and then serve the results to the frontend. I was asked to submit the code by pushing into a private GitHub repo. Web App Discussion + Technical Round – 1 hour # The interview started with how I built the web app and what were the challenges faced. Then I was asked some fundamental questions from OS, DBMS \u0026amp; Networks. I was also asked to explain about the technologies I had mentioned in my resume like Docker, MongoDB etc. (Pro Tip: Make sure you know to explain each word in your resume). The most-awaited DSA round – 1 hour # I was interviewed by someone who is an ICPC World Finalist for 2 times. Given an array of n positive integers with duplicates, how will you convert the array such that all elements are distinct with minimum number of moves. The catch is, you’re allowed to do only one kind of operation but can be repeated any number of times; for any pair in the array (Ai, Aj) can be converted to (Ai, Ai + Aj) After some time of thinking and discussing with the interviewer, I was able to come up with a solution using hash-maps in quadratic time. Then, I was asked to optimise. After doing a dry run through few examples I observed something (replacing any element with the sum of itself and maximum element in the array), and came up with a solution in linear time. And then I was asked to code the same in my favourite language(C++). My suggestion here is to Think Aloud. Your thinking process matters more than the solution itself. Final round of Interview – 30 mins # This was more of an informal discussion about me, my family background, interests. All I had to do was to stay confident and share my stories. He also shared about the evolution of CodeChef and its culture. I was immediately informed that I was in. Here ends the one month long interview process and I’m selected for the Software Engineer Internship at CodeChef 🎉️\nPreparation Strategies and Tips # There’s no shortcut to mastery. Practice. DSA is very essential for any computer science engineer, which I realised very lately, since web frameworks may come and go but this subject has existed and will continue to do so as long as data exists. Hence, the high priority given to it by most product development companies. If you’ve long enough time to prepare, you can improve your logical thinking skills by solving problems at CodeChef, Codeforces and also follow the next point. But if the time is short, then it’s better to go for practising standard DSA questions on GeeksForGeeks, HackerRank, Leetcode. Well even if you’re good at DSA, it isn’t sufficient to pass an interview of this kind unless you’ve some experience with web development. For that I would suggest you to learn some latest web/mobile app technologies and build some side projects. Also try contributing to open-source projects in GitHub so you’ve a better understanding of how coding looks like in real life. Prepare your LinkedIn profile and be an active user. You might find an opportunity anytime just like I did. It also helps you to improve your professional network.
