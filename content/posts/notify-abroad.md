When I came to the US for my master's, it was an unavoidable need to have access to the OTPs or calls that come to my Indian number, which, by the way, I left at home. Since it was not feasible to contact a human in India, who can relay the OTPs, everytime it is received by the Indian number, I built an app to forward 'em automatically to my telegram chat and called it 'Notify Abroad'.
