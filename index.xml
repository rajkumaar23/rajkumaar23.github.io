According to a survey by The Healthy Work Company, a workplace mental health consultancy, 22% of respondents had taken up a new pastime in lockdown, while 35% had rediscovered an old one.

After having used the OS, I wanted to contribute to it in some way or the other. And I started doing so by contributing to a currency converter app called Moneta which is available to download from elementary&amp;rsquo;s AppCenter.</description></item><item><title>Amrita Repository - Suite of Apps</title><link>https://rajkumaar.co.in/posts/amrita-repository/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2020 18:34:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rajkumaar.co.in/posts/amrita-repository/</guid><description>In my first year of college, during the time of examinations more than 60% of my class used to pester those one or two guys who used to download the previous year question papers for reference from an intranet site (which still remains a mystery to most of the students).

I started my development with mainly Android apps made out of Java, then got to explore web technologies such as Laravel, NodeJS, Angular etc.
The software I mostly use are :
Jetbrains suite of IDEs for development. Sublime Text for quick text editing. Sublime Merge for complex git stuff. Duckduckgo mostly, Startpage rarely.</description></item><item><title>Book Shelf</title><link>https://rajkumaar.co.in/books/shelf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rajkumaar.co.in/books/shelf/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
