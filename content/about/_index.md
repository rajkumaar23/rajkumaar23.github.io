Here's a brief intro â€“ since I'm not quite as famous as Robert Downey Jr. to say, "You know who I am."
{{< /lead >}}

Howdy! I'm Rajkumar, a curious software engineer who's always in awe of the wonders that 0<sub>s</sub> and 1<sub>s</sub> could create. I graduated in 2021 with a <a target='_blank' href='/pdf-js/web/viewer.html?file=/academics/btech.pdf'>B.Tech</a> in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita University, and I recently earned my <a target='_blank' href='/pdf-js/web/viewer.html?file=/academics/ms.pdf#page=2'>MS</a> in Computer Science (with distinction) from Arizona State University in December '23.

I've got over a year of full-time software engineering experience plus more than a year of interning at [CodeChef](https://codechef.com), a competitive programming platform. Most recently, I worked in the Developer Environments team at [Cruise](https://getcruise.com) as an intern. I love building [products](/projects) that make a positive impact on society, and I'm a big advocate for free &amp; open-source software.

I'm a quick learner, juggling between multiple programming languages (*call me a poly-code-glot*). I enjoy automating mundane tasks and testing/deploying on my Raspberry Pi. In my downtime, you'll find me occasionally [reading](/books/shelf) a non-fiction book, cooking a delicious dish, (or) catching up on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com).

I'm all about privacy, and I often share my thoughts on it over on my website. Check out [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io) if you're keen on learning more. 

Feel free to drop a line to [me@rajkumaar.co.in](mailto:me@rajkumaar.co.in) if you want to chat about anything!
