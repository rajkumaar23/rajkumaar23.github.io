I am constantly in awe of the wonders that 0<sub>s</sub> and 1<sub>s</sub> can create, and I have a great appreciation for the world where imagination dances with algorithms, and the possibilities, my friend, are as infinite as the digits of π.</p><p>As a developer, I&rsquo;ve delved into various technologies, including Java for Android app development, Laravel, NodeJS, Angular, and more. When it comes to software, I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Jetbrains suite of IDEs for development, Sublime Text for quick text editing, and Sublime Merge for all my complex git needs. As for search engines, I mostly use Duckduckgo, although I do occasionally dabble with Google for programming related queries.</p><p>I have a particular passion for Linux ♥ and open-source software. In fact, I&rsquo;ve been a proud Linux user since my first year of college, and I&rsquo;ve hopped between multiple distributions over the years. My favorite is currently <a href=https://elementary.io>elementaryOS</a> for its simple, clean, and non-intrusive interface, which allows me to be more productive.</p><p>Aside from Linux, I&rsquo;m also a huge fan of Apple products and their obsession with providing a seamless user experience. I currently use an iPhone XR and a MacBook Air (i5 10<sup>th</sup> gen) for my daily personal usage.</p><p>One of my biggest fascinations is software exploitation, and I find myself just as intrigued with breaking software as I am with building it. I&rsquo;ve reported numerous bugs and have even received bounties. I&rsquo;m particularly interested in web security and look forward to learning more about it.</p><p>In addition to software security, I&rsquo;m also a strong advocate for privacy. As they say, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not paying for a product, then you&rsquo;re the product.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why I care deeply about privacy and often preach about it on my website. I encourage everyone to check out <a href=https://privacytools.io>privacytools.io</a> to learn more.</p><p>As for analytics, my website uses privacy-friendly web analytics software called <a href=https://plausible.io>Plausible</a>, which doesn&rsquo;t track any of your personal data and is hosted on a Raspberry Pi at my home.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to discuss anything with me, don&rsquo;t hesitate to drop me a line at <a href=mailto:me@rajkumaar.co.in>me@rajkumaar.co.in</a>. I&rsquo;d be more than happy to chat!</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2023 • Rajkumar • <a href=https://rajkumaar.co.in/posts/index.xml target=_blank title=rss><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-rss"><path d="M4 11a9 9 0 019 9"/><path d="M4 4a16 16 0 0116 16"/><circle cx="5" cy="19" r="1"/></svg></a></span></div></div></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.44a8729d51a9195c311dd7ce95b0f12b3b780d107eda70e460452897c84117dc44a55188cbef8fd7cf40a6b7e14731b96029ee23f50acbe6a548069695ecd64f.js integrity="sha512-RKhynVGpGVwxHdfOlbDxKzt4DRB+2nDkYEUol8hBF9xEpVGIy++P189AprfhRzG5YCnuI/UKy+alSAaWlezWTw=="></script><script defer data-domain=rajkumaar.co.in src=https://plausible.pi.rajkumaar.co.in/js/script.js></script></body></html>
