Let's see how to build a basic Java Enterprise (fondly known as J2EE) application, made up of a Servlet and a JSP file, with the help of the popular IDE by Jetbrains, IntelliJ Idea. Finally, we will have a look at how to deploy the same on the Heroku cloud. ðŸŒ§

In the first place, I'm writing this blog because I couldn't find a full-fledged write-up on how to do this myself initially and I had to try and err to find out the right way to do it.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit**, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **IntelliJ Idea Ultimate Edition**, download it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). The ultimate edition is **paid**, but comes with a 30-day trial license. However, as long as you are a student, you can claim an educational license for free. More about it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).
- **Heroku** account. If you don't have, create one for free [here](https://signup.heroku.com).
- Heroku **CLI**. Find the instructions [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
- **Tomcat** server. You need to download the same from [this link](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi), under Binary Distributions > Core > zip. After downloading, make sure to extract the contents to any folder of your wish.
  - If you're on Linux/macOS, you'll need to enable executable permission for the tomcat binaries by running the following command on your terminal. 
  - `sudo chmod -R +x <path-to-tomcat-extracted-folder>/bin`

## Let's start engineering!
- Open IntelliJ Idea Ultimate and create a new project.
![IntelliJ Idea home](intellij-home.png)
- Create a Java Enterprise project, with Maven as the build tool, JUnit as the test runner, and Java as the language.
![Creating J2EE project](create-j2ee.png)
- In the next window, under Specifications, mark the checkbox for **Servlet** and ignore the rest.

- Regarding the project name and properties, you can fill in as you wish, and click on Finish!
![Project Properties](project-properties.png)
- Now, the creation of the project is complete and the IDE might take sometime to load all the necessary plugins/dependencies.
- If you look at the project directory, there will be a **pom.xml** at the root of the file. This is the file which Maven uses to maintain the dependencies of your project. Essentially, it's similar to a package.json in NodeJS (or) composer.json in PHP.
> Incase you ever want to add a library, say MySQL connector, you'll need to get its dependency XML tag from [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.21) and paste inside your pom.xml. After which, you'll see a tiny dialog on your top-right with a refresh button which on clicking will install the newly added package.

## JSP
- Let's create a [JSP](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/index.htm) file. Right click on `Project Folder > src > main > webapp` from the sidebar, and create a JSP file named __hello.jsp__, and fill in some JSP content.
![Creating JSP file](create-jsp.png)
- Click on **Add configuration** at the center top. After the window opens, click on the **+** button as instructed, and choose `Tomcat server > Local`.
- Give it a name as you wish, and near the **Application server** input box, click on the **configure** button. Now, enter the folder path where you extracted the zip of the Tomcat server.

- If you see a warning at the bottom saying __No artifacts marked for deployment__, click the **Fix** button near the warning and choose **ProjectName:war exploded**. Then, click Okay.
- Now, you'll see a neat Run button at the top. Click on it and wait until Java compiles your web app and opens your default browser.
- Your browser would have opened the URL of your application context, similar to `localhost:8080/J2EEDemo_war_exploded`. This is the root of your web application. Append **/hello.jsp** to your current URL (it becomes `http://localhost:8080/J2EEDemo_war_exploded/hello.jsp`) and enter. You'll see the contents you wrote in your hello.jsp.

## Servlet
- Let's create a Servlet now. Right-click on `Project Folder > src > main > java` from the sidebar and create a new Java Servlet. Enter the name and package as you wish. 
![Creating servlet](new-servlet.png)
![Creating servlet](servlet.png)
- Under the doGet() method, paste the following code : 
```java
@WebServlet(name = "LoginServlet")
public class LoginServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("You are at login page");
    }
}
```
- Next thing to do is assign an URL to this servlet. Open `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml` and paste the following : 
> Make sure you change the servlet-class according to your package and class name.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd"
         version="4.0">
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>in.co.rajkumaar.LoginServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/login</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
```
- Now, click on the Run button again and select Restart server. 
- Visit [http://localhost:8080/J2EEDemo_war_exploded/login](http://localhost:8080/J2EEDemo_war_exploded/login) to get the contents from the servlet.

## Heroku
- Visit https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app and create a new app.
![Creating new Heroku app](heroku-new.png)
- On your IntelliJ Idea Ultimate, open the **Build** menu and click on Build artifacts. Choose AppName:war > Build.
- You'll be able to see a `J2EEDemo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` file inside the `target/` directory of your application. Right-click on the file and copy > Absolute Path.
![Target directory with WAR file](target.png)

- Open up your terminal/command prompt, and run `heroku login`.
- Authorize on the website it opens up for you.
- Come back to the terminal, and run `heroku plugins:install java`.
- Then, run the following command. Make sure you replace the **path for the WAR file** and your **application name**.
```bash
heroku war:deploy "/Users/rajkumar/Projects/J2EEDemo/target/J2EEDemo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war" -a j2ee-test-raj
```
